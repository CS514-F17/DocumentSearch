Project 1 - Document Search Helper
==================================

### Due TBD

The goal of this project is to implement two techniques used in data mining: cosine similarity and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). You will use the following programming concepts:

- Classes
- Methods
- File Input
- Iteration
- `ArrayList`

### Cosine Similarity

The [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. In information retrieval and data mining it is used as a measure of the similarity between two documents. Each document is represented as a multidimensional vector and the similarity is the cosine of the angle between the vectors.

### TF-IDF







### Submission Requirements

1. For this assignment, you will submit four files: `Pokemon.java`, `Pokedex.java`, `PokedexBuilder.java`, and `PokemonDriver.java`

2. Make sure your code follows all requirements in the [Style Guidelines](https://github.com/CS112-S17/notes/blob/master/style.md).

3. Follow the instructions in the [SVN Guide](https://github.com/CS112-S17/notes/blob/master/svn_guide.md) for submitting your solution by the deadline.

4. Make sure you have submitted your work in an SVN directory: `https://www.cs.usfca.edu/svn/<username>/cs112/project1`

### Academic Dishonesty

Any work you submit is expected to be your own original work. If you use any web resources in developing your code you are strongly advised to cite those resources. The only exception to this rule is code that is posted on the class website. The URL of the resource you used in a comment in your code is fine. If I google even a single line of uncited code and find it on the internet you may get a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class. You may also get a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class if your solution is at all similar to that of any other student.
